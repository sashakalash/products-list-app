# Angular 19 DummyJSON Product App

This is a simple Angular 19 application that fetches and displays products from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/). It includes product listing divided to 2 tabs, one's for the product list and the other's for Favorite product list with local persistence, and product details as a dialog window.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 19**
- **RxJS** for handling asynchronous data streams
- **SignalStore** for state management
- **Angular Material** for UI components

## Features

- Fetches and displays products using the `GET /products` endpoint.
- Displays products in a **grid layout** with:
  - **Title**
  - **Price**
  - **Thumbnail**
  - **Rating**
- Includes a dropdown to filter products by category using the `GET /products/categories` endpoint.

### 2. Product Details Modal
- Clicking on a product opens a modal with:
  - **Title**
  - **Description**
  - **Stock**
  - **Price**
  - **Images** (fetched from the API)
- Users can add products to the **Favorites list**.

### 3. Favorites Page
- A dedicated **"Favorites"** page to display saved products.
